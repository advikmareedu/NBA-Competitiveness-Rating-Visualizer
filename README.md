My NBA Competitive Analysis Visualizer project is a tool designed to analyze and visualize the competitiveness of the NBA over time. The project aims to provide insights into factors that may have influenced the competitiveness of the league using the statistics recorded from each game since the 1980-1981 season. By visualizing the competitiveness over these seasons using graphical methods, the trends in competitiveness in the NBA can then be analyzed.
